After attending a cybersecurity conference organized by Cybersafe Foundation in partnership with <span class="highlight">Enugu SMS Center</span>, I decided to shift my career into tech.<br><br>

            <p> In 2022, I bagan my journey in cloud security with <span class="highlight">Cybersafe Foundation</span>.
